This is a mobile app for personal use, written in Kotlin. It primarily consists of a webview wrapper for the mobile version of the Filmaffinity webapp.

On this website, you can find, read about, and rate movies, TV shows, or documentaries, among other things. One common use of this site is to create lists of movies or TV shows. Consequently, I often find myself keeping a tab open in my cellphone browser. This way, whenever someone recommends a movie, I can promptly save it to a list of 'Recommended Movies.'

This simple, personal mobile app aims to replace the need for keeping that browser tab open.
